/**
 Finds possible Fourtiles games by repeatedly generating random combinations of
 fourtiles until a combination is found that meets all the requirements.

 These requirements are:

 - Exactly ``numFourtilesPerGame`` fourtiles are constructible.
 - No words are constructible with more than ``numTilesPerFourtile`` tiles.
 - Each word is constructible using only one combination of tiles.
 - At least ``minWordsPerGame`` are constructible using between ``minTilesPerWord`` and ``numTilesPerFourtile`` tiles.

 Fourtiles are defined as words constructible with ``numTilesPerFourtile``
 tiles, with each tile having between ``minCharactersPerTile`` and
 ``maxCharactersPerTile`` characters. All words with sufficient characters to
 meet these criteria are candidate fourtiles.

 Games are found asynchronously when ``findGames(showProgress:)`` is called, and
 streamed to a given file handle in JSON format. The process can be interrupted
 at any point, though you will have to add the closing `]` in the output JSON.
