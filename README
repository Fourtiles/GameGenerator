OVERVIEW: Finds Fourtile games and streams the output as JSON, for use in the Fourtile web game.

This game attempts to find as many Fourtile games as possible. Games are
streamed in JSON format to stdout or a file. Games are found using a randomized
heuristic, so there is no guarantee that every possible game will be found. This
is why games are streamed to stdout as they are found: Finding each next game
becomes computationally more expensive as more randomizations are required.

It is the intention that the user will abort this script when the time to find
the next game becomes unreasonable, and the user is satisfied with the number
of games found. The only required step is then to clean up the end of the JSON
file.

When writing games to a file, stdout is used to show a progress indicator, which
is normalized to the theoretical maximum number of possible games.
